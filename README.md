BREAKOUT (3 minutes)
If 3 letter carriers must deliver the same exact number of letters, and there are 299 letters, how many letters will not be delivered? Write a Python expression that answers this question.
If you have 5 bank tellers and 28 people waiting to be served, what is the least number of people who will not be served if it takes exactly 4 minutes to serve each person and the bank MUST close in 20 minutes? Write a Python expression that answers this question.

#END

REVIEW BREAKOUT
What are the two types of comments?

#True #False (WRONG) i guess . .

SINGLE LINE AND BLOCK #Right
What does the type() function do?

#Defines type of value.

#What are some differences between the int and float types?

#int = always a whole number.
#float = always a decimal number.

#NOTE
Sanity Check:

print ("Hello, World!")

#Let's you know that coding is working and you can continue to troubleshoot.

# Python Variables and Logic
    #declaring variables; variable naming syntax

# Covering
    #1. data types - some vocabulary will need to be memorized.
        #a. int
        #b. float
            #i. underflow
        #c. bool
        #d. str
        #e. None

    #2. abstractions - make things easier. when you take a complicated idea and you wrap it up in a simple idea.
        #a. functions.
        #b. variables.
    #3. control flow - lets us write dynamic code.
    #4. iteration - lets us repeat processes a number of times.

#below was in regard to abstraction explanation. idk.

# float underflow

    print( 1/10**1000) #float underflow example because answer becomes (0.0)

# truthyness and falsyness

    print(bool(3)) #True
    print(bool(1)) #True

    print(bool(0)) #False

    print(bool(0.0)) #False

    #0 is the only falsy. Everything else is true.

# # concatenation - is when you add two strings together

    EX:

    print ("Hello " + "World") #Hello World

#None is the only value that has .. no .. value.
