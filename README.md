# July 2021 DSI Premium Preparation Course Day 2
   #Notes from second day of class. 
    #Class Day Two

# On Quotes & Tics.
   #Quote marks with either ('') or ("") are both considered strings. However, single tic quotes(') may intefer with apostrophes.
   
    EX:
    ('there's') would interfere with the string.
    
    "Hello World!"
    
    print ("Hello World!")

# On Reading Numbers.
   #To have Python read numbers write them like this (73).
   
    (73) #Right
    
    print (73) #Right
    
    73 #Wrong
    
    print 73 #Wrong

# On Defining Float & Int.
   #Integer data types must be whole numbers. A floating point (float) is computer science terminology for containing decimal points.
    EX:
   
    print(73+7)
    
    print(73-7)
    
    print(73*7)
    
    print(73/7)
    
    print(73//7)
    
    print(73%7)
    
 # More On Floats and Int.

   #Mixing floats and ints in 1 operation always result into float.

    print(73+7) #80
    
    print(73-7) #66
    
    print(73*7) #511
    
    print(73/7) #10.428571428571429
    
    print(73//7) #10
    
    print(73%7) #3
    
 #int and float encode different in memory.

# On Equality Operators.
   #(==) is the equality operator. It shows us if something is indeed equal to something else.

    print (7==8) #False

    print (7==7.0) #True

# On Boolean's or bool.
   #bool also known as a boolean has two possible values. True & False.

    True
    
    False

# On Finding the Type of Value.
   #If you ever want to get a "type" of something you can use "type".
  
    EX:

    print (type(4)) #class 'int'

    print(type(3.2)) #class 'float'

    print (type(4%7)) #class 'int'

    print (type (7==9.0)) #class 'bool'

    1.0 == 1 #True
    1.0 == 1 #True

    type(1.0) == type(1) #False
    type(5) == type(1) #True
    
 # On How to Invoke Code.
 
 #print (   ) = is an invocation code. It displays something on the console/terminal. It's a way of seeing the code in the console.
    
    #A function call example is: print(  ).
    #In order to invoke something you must wrap it in parenthesis.
    
    EX:
    
    print( type() ) #invokes a type to display.

# BREAKOUT
#Solve Problem.
    
    print(type(74)) #<class 'int'>
      
      #END

# On Parenthesis and (PEMDAS) Parenthesis, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.
#The order the math executes upon depends on parenthesis and PEMDAS.

    print ( 7 + 3 * 10) #37
    
    print ( 7 + (3 * 10)) #37
    
    print ((7 + 3) * 10) #100

# BREAKOUT
#Add 5 and 7.2, multiply the result by 6, divide that result by 3, then square the result.

    print ((((5+7.2) * 6) / 3) ** 2) #595.3599999999998 = Right
    
    print (5+7.2 * 6 / 3 ** 2) #9.8 = Wrong

      #END

# On Casting (a.k.a) Converting.

#Casting: int(x), float(x) also known as "Converting".

    print ( float(4) ) #4.0
    
    print ( int(4.0) ) #4
    
    print ( int(4.334570)) #4 . . . Even though a decimal is normally a float we converted or #Cast it by putting "int" in front of it.

# On Input Types (float, Int).
#A "float" has a decimal. A "int" does not, because it is a whole number.

    print ( 5 + 3) #int or 8
    
    print (5.0 + 3) #float or 8.0
    
    print (5.0 +3.0) #float or 8.0

# On Floor Division.
#Floor division always gives you a whole number back.

    print (10 // 3) #int or 3
    
    print (10.0 // 3) #float or 3.0
    
    print (10 // 3.0) #float or 3.0
    
    print (10.0 // 3.0) #float or 3.0
    
#That whole number can be a float or an int.

# On Modulo, mod, or "Remainder" Operator.
#A mod is the remainder of a divided variable.
   
    EX:
    
    print (10%3) #1.
    
#Three goes into 10 three times 10/3 = 9 with a 'remainder' of 1. Answer is 1.


# On Assignment Operator. 
#An assignment operator assigns a value into an identifier.
    
    EX:
    
    a = 5
   
   #A variable is some piece of data you give a name to.
   
    #I am assigning the value (5) to the identifier/variable (a).
    
    EX:
    
    a = 5 * 3
    b = a / 2
    c = a * b

    print (c) #112.5

    EX:
    
    a = 5
    b = a + 3 #8
    a = 0

    print (b) #8 with explanation in #NOTE.
   
   #NOTE: Python evaluates top to bottom, left to right.
    
# On What is Snake Casing.

#Snake Casing is the underscore used to name variables. 

    EX:
    
    (this_is_an_example).
    
    (this_is_another_example).

# "It's Like Castling in Chess" Examples Below.
#I don't remember the actual name for this process, but . .

    #counter = 0
    #print (counter) #0

    #counter = counter + 1
    #print (counter) #1
    
   #this "+=" replaces the (counter = counter + 1) variable.
    
    #counter +=1 
    #print (counter) #1

    #num = 10
    #print(num) #10

    #num += 15
    #print(num) #25

    #num += (10 - num)

    #print (num)


# BREAKOUT

   1. print the result of multiplying by 7 the addition of 6 and 3.
   2. print the product of 7 times 6, squared, with 23 subtracted from the result.
   3. print the division of the result of 4 minus 2 times 2 into twenty.

    #print ((6 + 3) * 7) #63

    #print (((7 * 6)**2) - 23) #1741

    #print ((4-2) * (20/2)) #20.0
