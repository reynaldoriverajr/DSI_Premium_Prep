# Breakout (3 minutes).
If 3 letter carriers must deliver the same exact number of letters, and there are 299 letters, how many letters will not be delivered? Write a Python expression that answers this question.
If you have 5 bank tellers and 28 people waiting to be served, what is the least number of people who will not be served if it takes exactly 4 minutes to serve each person and the bank MUST close in 20 minutes? Write a Python expression that answers this question.

      #letter_carriers = 3

      #letters = 299

      #print (letters%letter_carriers)

      #END

What are the two types of comments?

      #1. Single Line
      #2. Block Line

What does the type() function do?

      #Defines type of value.

#What are some differences between the int and float types?

      #int = always a whole number.
      #float = always a decimal number.

# What is a Sanity Check?
Sanity Check - Helps the coder know that the program is working as intended.

      print ("Hello, World!")

      #Let's you know that coding is working and you can continue to troubleshoot.

# Python Variables and Logic.
    #declaring variables; variable naming syntax
    #logic operators
    #control flow

# Covering Definitions.
   #1. data types - some vocabulary will need to be memorized.
 
        #a. int
        #b. float
            #i. underflow
        #c. bool
        #d. str
        #e. None


   #2. abstractions - make things easier. when you take a complicated idea and you wrap it up in a simple idea.
   
        #a. functions.
        #b. variables.
    
   #3. control flow - lets us write dynamic code.
   #4. iteration - lets us repeat processes a number of times.

# Below Was in Regard to Abstraction Explanation. idk. I Got Confused.

      n = 4

      print(1/233) #0.004291845493562232

# Float Underflow.
#float underflow example because answer becomes (0.0)
    
    print( 1/10**1000) #(0,0)

# Truthyness and Falsyness.

    print(bool(3)) #True
    print(bool(1)) #True

    print(bool(0)) #False

    print(bool(0.0)) #False

    #0 is the only falsy. Everything else is truthy.


# Strings.

    print(bool("") #False

    print(bool("anything")) #True

    print(bool("false")) #True

    print("bool " + "False") #bool False


# Concatenation.
   #Is When You Add Two Strings Together.

    EX:

    print ("Hello " + "World") #Hello World


# What is None.

   #None is the only value that has .. no .. value.
        
      print(None) #None

      print(print("hello")) #output is ("hello" + "None")

# I Should Revise Scratch Notes Below.

# Boolean Operators.

    Operator = (>) Greater Than

    Operator = (>=) Greather Than or Equal

    print(not False) #True

    print(True and True) #True

    print(True and False) #False
